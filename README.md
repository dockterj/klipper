# Mightyboard Rev G and H support - Fork of Klipper3d/klipper

This fork adds support for Makerbot Replicator 2/2X
(Mightyboard Rev G and H) and some clones.

**STATUS -** I would consider master to be production ready.
Everything that can be supported is at this point and all
features are working.  This has been tested on a number
of printers and more wide spread testing would be appreciated.

**Supported Clones -**
Currently, no clones have example config files or instructions
for flashing Klipper.  If you have a Replicator clone that
uses k type thermocouples and/or an ADS1118 ADC chip and
want to get Klipper running on it let me know and submit
a sample config file and flashing instructions and I will
include them in this repo.

**Printers that may use ADS1118 ADCs and may work with this repo include:**
- FlashForge Dreamer NX
- FlashForge Dreamer
- FlashForge Inventor
- Dremel 3D20
- Dremel 3D40 (known to work)
- PowerSpec Ultra 3D
- Monoprice Inventor 1

**Changes include:**
* Documents what is necessary to flash the MCU (57600 baud and correct 
    avrdude protocol)
* Adds support for MCU reset (toggle connection baud rate to 57600)
* Adds support for ADS1118 and k-type thermocouples (one or two extruders)
* Adds support for hardware blinking of the LEDs
* ~Adds support for multiple buttons with same action in display~
* Adds support for a forward_button in addition to a click_button
* Removes the need for specifying dummy pins for software spi devices
* Adds example g code macros to emulate some original Makerbot behaviors

See the changelog for more details.  `CHANGES.md`

**Example Configs:**

`/config/printer-makerbot-replicator2-2012.cfg` can be used as a starting point for the Replicator 2.

`/config/printer-makerbot-replicator2x-2012.cfg` can be used as a starting point for the Replicator 2X.

# Installation

<details><summary>KIAUH</summary>
<p>

**NOTE:** KIAUH takes a little bit more work to set up, but is ideal for running
multiple instances of klipper, and also makes it possible to install any and
all frontends including Mainsail, Fluidd, and Octoprint! A huge thanks to
th33xitus for making [KIAUH](https://github.com/th33xitus/kiauh)!

**Step 1:**

Follow the instruction on [KIAUH's github page](https://github.com/th33xitus/kiauh#--%EF%B8%8F-instructions-) to install both the recommended operating
system for KIAUH and the script itself.

**Step 2:**

KIAUH is set by default to install klipper from the klipper3d repo, however, we
need to install it from the dockterj branch. This can be accomplished by editing
the file `klipper_repos.txt.example`.

SSH into your raspberry pi, and run the following commands:
```
cd kiauh
sudo nano klipper_repos.txt.example
```
Now, you should be presented with a screen that looks like this:

![](https://i.imgur.com/kWNYJNQ.png)

Delete the four uncommented lines, and add the line `https://github.com/dockterj/klipper` in their place.
Your screen should now look like this:

![](https://i.imgur.com/UTat7JL.png)

Now, hit Control+x to exit, then hit `y` to save the modified buffer.

**You must save the file as `klipper_repos.txt`, otherwise KIAUH will not recognize the file as valid.**

Hit `y` to save the file under a different name.

If you want to check to be sure the edit was successful, you can type `ls` into the command line. If the
file `klipper_repos.txt` is there, then the edit was successful.

**Step 3:**

Now you're ready to start KIAUH! Enter `./kiauh/kiauh.sh` to start the script.

Once in KIAUH, you should see a screen like this:

![](https://i.imgur.com/mJKOZqq.png)

KIAUH, by default, uses the official master branch of klipper. To tell KIAUH to
use this branch instead, we need to add the custom repo you created to KIAUH.

Input the number `6` to enter KIAUH's settings, then hit enter. 
You should now see a screen like this:

![](https://i.imgur.com/AMtFrQm.png)

Input `1` to set the custom repository. You'll see a screen like this:

![](https://i.imgur.com/w1uRnS1.png)

Input `0` to set the custom repository, you'll be presented with a screen like this:

![](https://i.imgur.com/0CWf11R.png)

Then input `b` and `b` again to get back to the main menu.

**Step 4:**

Now you can install Klipper! Input `1` to get to the installation menu. Once there,
input `1` again to enter the klipper installation procedure.

Input `1` to install python 3.x, then set the number of Klipper instances your would
like to install.

![](https://i.imgur.com/lEuWk4T.png)

You may be presented with a prompt like this:

![](https://i.imgur.com/mHdaWpC.png)

Input `y` for this prompt to avoid potential problems down the road.

Let the process complete, and now Klipper is fully installed! From here you can
install Moonraker, your interface of choice, and whatever other programs you may want 
that KIAUH offers.

**Step 5:**

Depending on the printer that you are running, you will either want to use the
`/config/printer-makerbot-replicator2-2012.cfg` config file or the
`/config/printer-makerbot-replicator2x-2012.cfg` config file.

Mainsail and Fluidd both allow you to copy over example configs from
within the web interface, however, Octoprint does not. These following steps
will detail the process of doing this through the ssh terminal. If this does
not apply to you, you can skip to the next step.
    
If you are still in KIAUH, input `Q` to close it, then type `cd` to navigate
back to the pi directory, which is represented by a `~`. The text preceding
your cursor will look similar to `pi@replicator2x:~ $`
    
Type `cd klipper/config` into the command line. You are now in Klipper's example
config folder. Type either `cp printer-makerbot-replicator2-2012.cfg ~/printer_data/config/`
or `cp printer-makerbot-replicator2x-2012.cfg ~/printer_data/config/` to copy the example
config for your printer into your printer's configuration directory.
    
Now type `cd ~/printer_data/config` to move over to your printer's configuration directory.
Type `rm printer.cfg` to remove the placeholder printer config that comes with klipper. Now
type `mv printer-makerbot-replicator2-2012.cfg printer.cfg` or 
`mv printer-makerbot-replicator2x-2012.cfg printer.cfg`, depening on your printer, to rename
the example config to the config name recognized by Klipper.

**Step 6:**

Now we're going to flash Klipper to the printer's mainboard.
    
Plug the printer into one of the Pi's usb ports. Verify that the device
appears in /dev/serial/by-id by executing the command `ls /dev/serial/by-id`.
If the printer is connected, this command will return a dialogue that looks like
this:

![](https://i.imgur.com/zxS6FMs.png)

Copy this by highlighting it, then right clicking it. Open up a temporary notepad document
and paste it into that, you'll need this to update your printer.cfg.

Find the section of your config that looks like this:
```
[mcu]
serial: dev/serial/by-id/[your-serial-id-here]
restart_method: mightyboard
baud: 250000
```

Update the `serial: [your-serial-id-here]` line with the line you saved earlier.
When completed the line should look similar to:
```
serial: /dev/serial/by-id/usb-MakerBot_Industries_The_Replicator_5533034353435160A141-if00
```
    
Now, go back to the command line and run:
```
cd ~/klipper/
make menuconfig
```
   
In this menu, choose the atmega1280, 16mhz, and uart0.

**Note:** See below for the note about atmega2560.
    
Once you enter those settings, hit `Q` to exit, then `Y` to save.
    
Now run the command `make`. This will build the firmware for your
particular machine.
    
Now, run the commands:
```
sudo service klipper stop
make flash FLASH_DEVICE=/dev/serial/by-id/dev/serial/by-id/[your-serial-id-here]
sudo service klipper start
```
Where an example of FLASH_DEVICE will look like:
```
FLASH_DEVICE=/dev/serial/by-id/dev/serial/by-id/usb-MakerBot_Industries_The_Replicator_5533034353435160A141-if00
```
This will flash your printer. If it fails, you may need to power off and then power on your printer,
or attempt to connect and disconnect with Klipper. It should flash after you try one or both of these things.

Congratulations! You now have Klipper installed on your Replicator 2 or 2X!

of your printer and to learn the specifics of what Klipper is capable of.

</details>

<details><summary>Mainsail OS</summary>
<p>

**NOTE:** You can use any frontend and install method you want.  The only changes needed from
this repo are already built into Klipper.

**NOTE:** There is a bug in Mainsail OS v1.0.1 that will cause the wifi
connection to bounce up and down until Sonar is updated.  To work around
this bug, once the Pi has booted IMMEDIATELY SSH into the Pi and execute
`systemctl stop sonar`.  After that navigate to the Machine page and update
all components.

Create an SD card with Mainsail OS using [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) [Follow the
instructions from [Mainsail OS](https://docs.mainsail.xyz/setup/mainsail-os)].

SSH into the Pi (user pi, password is what you set up when you created
the SD card).  Execute the following commands:

```
mv klipper klipper-orig
git clone https://github.com/dockterj/klipper
systemctl restart klipper
```

At this point if you refresh the update manager on the machine page it will
say that klipper is invalid.  Ignore this and don't click on `"hard recovery"`
or `"soft recovery"`.  Klipper should also report `ERROR`.  This is normal as
there is no printer configured yet.

Copy [/config/printer-makerbot-replicator2-2012.cfg](/config/printer-makerbot-replicator2-2012.cfg) or [/config/printer-makerbot-replicator2x-2012.cfg](/config/printer-makerbot-replicator2x-2012.cfg) to printer.cfg.  An
easy way to do this is to change the root directory in Config File
(on the Machine tab) to `config_examples`.  Find `printer-makerbot-replicator2-2012.cfg` or `printer-makerbot-replicator2x-2012.cfg`, right click and download
it.  Change the root directory back to `config`, upload that file, then
rename it `printer.cfg`.

Plug the printer into the Pi's usb port and verify that the device
appears in /dev/serial/by-id by executing the following:
```
ls /dev/serial/by-id
```
It should return a line similar to the following:
```
/dev/serial/by-id/usb-MakerBot_Industries_The_Replicator_A413936383135181D010-if00
```
Make a note of this so that you can update
`printer.cfg` in the next steps.

You can edit `printer.cfg` to add/remove features specific to your printer
(e.g. remove HBP, change the HBP sensor to match what you have,
change x,y, and z limits, etc...).  Update the `serial:` line under the `[mcu]` 
section to match the filename found in the previous step.  Add the following 
line at the top of your `printer.cfg` to enable Mainsail support.
```
[include mainsail.cfg]
```
Click Save and Restart.

Following the normal installation steps, run `make menuconfig`.  Choose 
an atmega1280, 16mhz, and uart0.  (see [below for note about atmega2560](#notes)).

Edit src/svr/Makefile and change the line that sets FLASH_DEVICE to
point to your mcu (the same /dev/serial/by-id that you changed in
printer.cfg).  Save your changes.

Run make flash.  This should flash your mightyboard.  If not, I have
found times where I needed to power the mightboard off and back on
or attempt to connect and disconnect with Klipper (i.e. connect at a
speed other than 57600 first) before it would flash.

At this point you should have Klipper running on your Replicator.

Follow the normal [Klipper documentation](https://www.klipper3d.org/) for further tuning.

# Notes
* The Sailfish firmware has profiles for Mightyboard Rev G and Rev
H printers that have an atmega2560 instead of an atmega1280.  If you have
one of these please let me know so I can get a known working config for them.
I believe you should be able to get this working by changing the MCU
processor in `make menuconfig`, editing `src/arv/Makefile`, and changing
the last line from `-C stk500v1` to `-C stk500v2`.  Software reset
should work but needs to be tested to confirm.

* The `generic-mightyboard.cfg` in the main repo should NOT be use
for these printers.  That config file is for the original
Makerbot Replicator and clones and does not work with printers
that have ADS1118 ADC and thermocouples (Rep2 and Rep2X).

* There is no specific error for a disconnected thermocouple, however
the printer will shut down if a thermocouple is not attached (this
triggers a temperature out of range error).

* The included `printer.cfg` changes the origin (0,0) to be in the left front of the build
plate to be consistent with other cartesian printers.  Keeping the original
Replicator origin (which resembles a delta printer, i.e. origin is in the center of the bed) requires updating
position_min, position_max, position_endstop, and bed_screws values for the
x and y axes.

* Please watch or star this repo if you are interested.  The more
people that use this the better the chances of getting it included
upstream.  Feel free to file issues in this repo for questions or
problems (DON'T USE ISSUES IN UPSTREAM FOR THIS)
